# Machine Learning and Deep Learning Cheatsheet

## Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. The goal of machine learning is to allow computers to learn and improve their performance on a specific task without being explicitly programmed for that task.

At its core, machine learning revolves around the idea of finding patterns and relationships within data. These patterns are then used to make predictions or classifications on new, unseen data. The process of learning from data involves creating a model or algorithm that can generalize and make accurate predictions on new, previously unseen instances.

## Types of Machine Learning

1. **Supervised Learning:** In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, where the input data is paired with corresponding output labels. The goal is for the algorithm to learn the mapping between input and output, so it can make accurate predictions on new data. Examples of supervised learning tasks include image classification, speech recognition, and sentiment analysis.

2. **Unsupervised Learning:** In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is trained on an unlabeled dataset, where there are no output labels. The objective is to find patterns, structure, or relationships within the data without explicit guidance. Clustering and dimensionality reduction are common unsupervised learning tasks.

3. **Reinforcement Learning:** Reinforcement learning involves an agent that learns to interact with an environment to achieve a goal. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties based on its actions, and its objective is to maximize the total reward over time. Reinforcement learning has applications in robotics, game playing, and autonomous systems.

## Key Terminology

- **Features:** In the context of machine learning, features refer to the input variables or attributes that are used to make predictions or classifications. For example, in a dataset of houses, the features could include the number of bedrooms, square footage, and location.

- **Labels:** Labels are the known output values in supervised learning. They represent the correct answer or ground truth that the algorithm is trying to learn. In a dataset of images of cats and dogs, the labels would indicate whether each image contains a cat or a dog.

- **Training:** The process of feeding data to the machine learning algorithm to enable it to learn from the examples and update its internal parameters. During training, the algorithm adjusts its parameters to minimize the difference between its predicted outputs and the true labels.

- **Testing:** After training the algorithm, it is evaluated on a separate dataset (testing set) to assess its performance and generalization to new, unseen data. Testing helps determine how well the model can make predictions on data it has not seen before.

## Machine Learning Algorithms

1. **Linear Regression:**
   - Concept and Application: Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting continuous numeric values. It fits a line to the data points that best represents the relationship between the input features and the target variable.
   - Cost Function and Optimization: The algorithm minimizes a cost function, typically the mean squared error, using optimization techniques like gradient descent.
   - Multiple Linear Regression: Extends linear regression to multiple input features.

2. **Logistic Regression:**
   - Binary and Multinomial Logistic Regression: Logistic regression is used for binary classification problems (two classes), but it can also handle multinomial classification problems (more than two classes).
   - Sigmoid Function: Logistic regression uses the sigmoid activation function to produce probabilities for the classes.
   - Maximum Likelihood Estimation: The algorithm maximizes the likelihood of the observed data given the model parameters during training.

3. **Decision Trees:**
   - Building Decision Trees: Decision trees recursively split the data based on the most significant features to create a tree-like structure for making decisions.
   - Entropy and Information Gain: Decision trees use entropy and information gain to measure the uncertainty in the data and choose the best split.
   - Pruning: To prevent overfitting, decision trees can be pruned to reduce their complexity.

4. **Random Forests:**
   - Ensemble Learning: Random forests combine multiple decision trees to make predictions. Each tree is trained on a random subset of features and data samples.
   - Bagging and Random Feature Selection: Random forests use bagging (bootstrap aggregating) to build multiple trees on random subsets of the data.
   - Advantages and Use Cases: Random forests are less prone to overfitting and can handle large datasets with high dimensionality.

5. **Support Vector Machines (SVM):**
   - Maximum Margin Classifier: SVM aims to find the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between data points of different classes.
   - Kernel Trick: SVM can handle non-linearly separable data by transforming it into a higher-dimensional space using a kernel function.
   - C-Support Vector Classification: The parameter C in SVM controls the tradeoff between maximizing the margin and minimizing the classification error.

6. **Naive Bayes:**
   - Bayes' Theorem: Naive Bayes is based on Bayes' theorem, which calculates the probability of a hypothesis given the observed evidence.
   - Naive Bayes Classifier: It is a probabilistic classifier that assumes independence between features given the class label.
   - Text Classification with Naive Bayes: Naive Bayes is commonly used in text classification tasks like spam detection and sentiment analysis.

7. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):**
   - Distance Metrics: KNN classifies data points by finding the k-nearest neighbors based on a distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance).
   - Choosing K: The value of k affects the decision boundary of the classifier. Choosing the right k is important for accurate predictions.
   - Curse of Dimensionality: KNN can suffer from the curse of dimensionality, where the performance degrades as the number of features increases.

8. **Neural Networks:**
   - Perceptrons and Activation Functions: Neural networks consist of interconnected layers of nodes (neurons) that use activation functions to introduce non-linearity.
   - Feedforward Neural Networks: The information flows from the input layer through hidden layers to the output layer without loops.
   - Backpropagation Algorithm: Backpropagation is used to update the neural network's parameters during training by minimizing the error between predicted and actual outputs.

9. **Gradient Boosting Methods:**
   - Introduction to Boosting: Gradient boosting is an ensemble learning method that builds strong models by combining weak learners (usually decision trees).
   - AdaBoost: AdaBoost is a boosting algorithm that assigns higher weights to misclassified instances to focus on difficult samples.
   - Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM): GBM minimizes a loss function by iteratively adding weak learners that reduce the error.

## Deep Learning

   - Activation Functions: Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the network, allowing it to learn complex patterns.
   - Loss Functions and Optimizers: Loss functions measure the error between predicted and actual outputs, and optimizers update the model parameters during training.

3. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN):**
   - Convolution and Pooling Layers: CNN uses convolutional and pooling layers to extract local features from images and reduce spatial dimensions.
   - Object Detection and Image Classification: CNNs are commonly used for tasks like object detection, image classification, and semantic segmentation.

4. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN):**
   - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): LSTMs are a type of RNN designed to address the vanishing gradient problem and handle long-range dependencies.
   - Applications in Natural Language Processing: RNNs and LSTMs are widely used for sequence-to-sequence tasks like machine translation and text generation.

5. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN):**
   - Generator and Discriminator: GANs consist of a generator and a discriminator that play a game to generate realistic data.
   - Image Generation and Applications: GANs are used for tasks like image-to-image translation, image super-resolution, and data augmentation.

6. **Transfer Learning:**
   - Pretrained Models: Transfer learning leverages knowledge from pre-trained models on large datasets to improve performance on smaller datasets.
   - Fine-Tuning and Feature Extraction: Fine-tuning involves updating the weights of pre-trained models on new data, while feature extraction uses the pre-trained model as a fixed feature extractor.

## Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy:** The proportion of correct predictions out of the total number of predictions made by the model. It is a simple and intuitive metric, but it may not be suitable for imbalanced datasets.
- **Precision, Recall, F1 Score:** Metrics used in binary classification tasks to evaluate the performance of the model on positive and negative instances.
  - **Precision:** The proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions. It indicates how many of the predicted positive instances are actually positive.
  - **Recall:** The proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances. It measures how well the model identifies positive instances.
  - **F1 Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall. It balances precision and recall, making it useful when there is an uneven class distribution.
- **Confusion Matrix:** A table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model by comparing predicted and actual class labels.
  - **True Positives (TP):** The number of positive instances correctly predicted as positive.
  - **True Negatives (TN):** The number of negative instances correctly predicted as negative.
  - **False Positives (FP):** The number of negative instances incorrectly predicted as positive.
  - **False Negatives (FN):** The number of positive instances incorrectly predicted as negative.
- **ROC Curve and AUC:** Tools for visualizing the tradeoff between true positive rate and false positive rate for different classification thresholds. The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) is a scalar value that quantifies the model's ability to distinguish between classes.

## Data Preprocessing

- **Data Cleaning:** The process of identifying and handling errors, missing values, and inconsistencies in the dataset. Cleaning the data ensures that the model is not biased by irrelevant or erroneous information.
- **Feature Scaling:** Normalizing or standardizing features to ensure they have similar scales, which helps improve model convergence and performance. Common scaling techniques include Min-Max scaling and z-score normalization.
- **Handling Missing Data:** Strategies to deal with missing values, such as imputation (replacing missing values with estimated values) or removal of incomplete data points.
- **One-Hot Encoding:** A technique to convert categorical variables into numerical form for model compatibility. Each category is represented as a binary vector, with a 1 in the corresponding category and 0 in all other categories.
- **Feature Selection:** Selecting the most relevant features from the dataset to reduce noise, improve model performance, and speed up training. Feature selection methods include statistical tests, feature importance scores from tree-based models, and recursive feature elimination.

## Model Evaluation and Validation

- **Train-Test Split:** Dividing the dataset into training and testing subsets to train the model on one and evaluate it on the other. The train-test split helps assess the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.
- **Cross-Validation:** A technique to evaluate model performance by dividing the data into multiple subsets (folds) and performing several training and testing cycles. Cross-validation provides a more robust estimate of model performance and helps avoid overfitting.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Adjusting hyperparameters (settings that are not learned during training) to optimize model performance. Hyperparameters control aspects like learning rate, regularization strength, and the number of layers in a neural network.
- **Overfitting and Underfitting:** Problems that occur when a model is too complex (overfitting) or too simple (underfitting) for the data. Overfitting refers to a model that has learned the noise in the training data and performs poorly on new data. Underfitting occurs when the model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data.

## Bias-Variance Tradeoff

The bias-variance tradeoff refers to the balance between a model's ability to capture the underlying patterns in the data (low bias) and its sensitivity to fluctuations or noise in the training data (low variance). A model with high bias may oversimplify the data and result in underfitting, while a model with high variance may overfit the training data and perform poorly on unseen data.

To achieve a good model performance, the goal is to find the right balance between bias and variance. Models that are too complex tend to have low bias but high variance, while simpler models tend to have higher bias but lower variance. The ideal model strikes a balance that results in good generalization to unseen data.

## Feature Engineering

- **Feature Extraction:** Creating new features from the existing data that provide additional insights and improve model performance. Feature extraction techniques include extracting statistical summaries, transforming time-series data, and using domain-specific knowledge to create relevant features.
- **Feature Transformation:** Applying mathematical transformations to the features to make them more suitable for modeling. Common transformations include logarithmic transformation, square root transformation, and Box-Cox transformation.
- **Feature Selection Techniques:** Selecting the most relevant features from the dataset to reduce noise, improve model performance, and speed up training. Feature selection methods include statistical tests, feature importance scores from tree-based models, and recursive feature elimination.

## Model Deployment and Productionization

- **Saving and Loading Models:** Techniques to save trained models to disk and load them for future use. Saving models allows for reusing the trained parameters without retraining the model from scratch.
- **Model Deployment Options (APIs, Web Applications):** Methods to deploy models as APIs or web applications to make predictions in real-time. Deployed models can be integrated into production systems to provide automated decision-making capabilities.
- **Monitoring and Updating Models:** Continuous monitoring of deployed models and updating them as new data becomes available or model performance changes. Regular updates and retraining help ensure that the model remains accurate and relevant as the data distribution evolves over time.
